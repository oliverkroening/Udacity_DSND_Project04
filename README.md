## 1. Installation <a name="installation"></a>

- This code was created by using Python versions 3.*.
- Following libraries were are required:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn

- copy repository: git clone https://github.com/oliverkroening/Udacity_DSND_Project04


## 2. Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
For this Udacity project, I used data from a Stack Overflow survey to analyse the trend of the data science community worldwide. Therefore, I was interested in the development of data science in different regions to find local peculiarities according to characteristics of data science. Furthermore, I wanted to gain knowledge about skills, requirements and prerequisites for beginning a career within the field of data science. Here, it was also interesting to find out what financial and other benefits in form of job/career satisfaction do data scientists have and which features can influence these parameters.

Therefore, I formulated these business questions:

> 1. What is the trend in Data Science community growth from 2011 to 2018?  
> 2. In which countries has the Data Science community grown?  
> 3. What is the trend in Data Science community growth in various countries over the years?  
> 4. In which Industries has the Data Science community grown and in what proportion? 
> 5. What is the trend in Data Science community growth in various industries over the years?  
> 6. In which companies(small, medium & large) has the Data Science community grown and in what proportion?
> 7. What is the trend in Data Science community growth in various different sized companies over the years?

## 3. File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>  
I have not uploaded the data files, because they are quite big. They can be downloaded on [Stack Overflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). Here you can also find the schemas for these datasets.

To avoid errors while running the code, you have to create two folders. The first folder 'data' contains the survey data as .csv-files. They have to be named as "survey_data_201X.csv". The schemas have to be put in another folder "schema" and should be named "survey_schema_201X.csv"
